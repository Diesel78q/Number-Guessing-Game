Project Name: Number Guessing Game

Description:
This project is a number guessing game implemented in Python. It was developed during the learning process to demonstrate programming skills and logic building. The game prompts the player to input the maximum natural number that can be guessed. A random number is generated within the specified range, and the player needs to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number, assisting the player in making subsequent guesses. Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends, and the total number of attempts is displayed. Players have the option to play again or exit the game.

Key Features:

Interactive command-line game that engages the player in guessing a randomly generated number.
Allows the player to set the maximum range for guessing the number.
Tracks the number of attempts made by the player and provides feedback on the relative position of the guessed number.
Ends the game when the correct number is guessed and displays the total number of attempts made.
Offers the option to play the game again or exit.
This project serves as a practical exercise in programming fundamentals, including user input, random number generation, conditional statements, and loop structures. It showcases the ability to create an interactive game that challenges players' intuition and logical thinking.
